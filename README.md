# Simple-Blockchain-Go
Implementation of the major concepts of Blockchain using Golang

This project is my initial venture into Blockchain.

### Improvements/Added features over the existing implementation in the article

- Proof of Work
- Add persistence (If one node is disconnected, all other nodes can still communicate)

### Pull requests

Whilst learning blockchain implementation from the above articles, I encountered some bugs and inconsistencies. I managed to figure them out and submitted a couple of pull requests addressing the same and also incorporated the same in my code.
